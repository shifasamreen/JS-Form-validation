<body>
   <!-- simple form with . Notice: action has the url of the page from where the resource shall be requested to the server
   Along with the form, the data of the form is also sent to the server.
   
   Now, the data will go to the application server via the Web server. PHP code runs on application server.
   
   Now, the ouput generated by the application server will be sent back to the web server. The web server then sends the response back to the browser.
   
   
In this process, form validation JS code is executed when the submit button is clicked.
  
  
  Form submission is nothing but an event. So JS function is executed when the event occurs.
  
 ALSO, the method='get' means that the url is sent after appending the data with it. 
  
  And, we create a function XYZ(validate in our case). onsubmit is a JS attribute used to handle events. Therefore onsubmit we want to run the function. hence the code below.
  
  Go to JS file for explaination
   -->
    <form action="registartions.php" method="get" onsubmit="return validate()">
        <span>
            Name: <input type="text" name="username">
        </span>
        <span>
            <input type="submit" name="Register"/>
        </span>
        
    </form>
    
</body>
